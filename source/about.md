I am a university student with major in Computer Science, and I am a very lazy person in doing repeating tasks. However, I am not good at remember things, so this blog is mainly used to record what I have experienced.


Some personal projects:
- [Truth table generator](http://jasonlhy.github.io/Truth-Table-Generator/) : a website used to compute truth table formula
- [Give Me Folder](https://github.com/Jasonlhy/Give-Me-Folder) : a small shell script used to organize files based on their filenames pattern
- [HouseGameSolver](https://github.com/Jasonlhy/HouseGameSolver) : a small haskell program used to solve [Knight's tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour)
- [National Tsing Hau University timetable generator](http://jasonlhy.github.io/national-tsing-hua-university-timetable-generator/)
